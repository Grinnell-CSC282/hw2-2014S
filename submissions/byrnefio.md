Setting Environment Variables 
=============================

Command line
------------
'$ set' displays the current environment variables. 
'$ echo [variable]' displays the settings for that variable. '$ echo PWD' displays the setting for your working directory, for example. 

Setting the environment variables depends on what shell you're using. You might use Bash, or C, or a number of others.
