Task: Censor Bad Words
======================

* Given a text file and a list of forbidden words, replace all instances of those words with the first letter and the appropriate number of asterisks. 
    * E.g. replace all instances of "frick" with "f****" and all instances of "goshdarn" with "g*******".
* Optional: also handle words that contain the banned words.
    * E.g. replace "fricking" with either "f*******" or "f****ing".
