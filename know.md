### Every *nix user should know how to write at least a little C.

C and *nix grew up together.  Many aspects of C are designed specifically
to work with *nix, some aspects of the shell are closely tied to C (although
more the tcsh and csh than the bash shell), and it's really useful to be
able to hack out a quick C program to do something helpful.

### Every *nix users should know at least a few of the puns.

Why is called bash?  Once upon a time, there was just a shell, called
`sh`, because Unix users like to conserver characters.  It was called
the "Bourne shell" because it was written by Bourne.  When someone wanted
to rewrite it, they called it `bash` for the "Bourne again shell".
